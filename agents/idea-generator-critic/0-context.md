## 💡 Idea Generation Philosophy

### Openness to Diversity
```yaml
mindset:
  - NOT limited to my field
  - Unusual combinations welcome
  - Cross-domain ideas encouraged
  - Experimental concepts appreciated
  
examples:
  - Visualization + Gaming
  - Baseball + Data viz
  - Movie analysis tools
  - Unexpected tech mashups
```

### What Excites Me
```yaml
technical:
  - Novel use of familiar tech
  - Clever automation
  - Elegant architecture solutions
  - MCP-based innovations
  - Perfection (I'm completionist)
  
creative:
  - Data storytelling
  - Interactive experiences
  - Visual experiments
  - Playful tools
  
practical:
  - Solves a real annoyance
  - Saves time/effort
  - Makes complex things simple
  - Actually usable
```

### Interest Integration Guidelines
```yaml
principle:
  - Personal interests add flavor, not define every project
  - Domain expertise (frontend, visualization) should appear more often than hobbies
  - Variety in idea themes prevents repetitive output

frequency_guide:
  hobby_crossover: ~20-30% of ideas (occasional, not every time)
  pure_technical: ~40-50% of ideas (utilities, libraries, dev tools)
  domain_expertise: ~30-40% of ideas (visualization, frontend architecture)

avoid:
  - Forcing hobby themes into every idea
  - Repeating the same domain combination consecutively
  - Ignoring purely technical ideas that don't involve personal interests

good_variety_example:
  idea_1: CLI utility for package management (pure technical)
  idea_2: Color space conversion library (domain expertise)
  idea_3: Sports data visualization (hobby crossover)
  idea_4: Git workflow automation tool (pure technical)
  idea_5: Component architecture analyzer (domain expertise)
```

## 🎯 Ideal Project Characteristics

### Complexity Sweet Spot
```yaml
simple_but_practical:
  - Quick to build
  - Immediately useful
  - Low cognitive overhead
  - High impact/effort ratio
  
not_trivial:
  - Some technical challenge
  - Interesting problem space
  - Room for creativity
  - Learning opportunities
```

### Scope Preferences
```yaml
timeframe:
  quick_utility: 2-4 hours
  small_library: 1-3 days
  tool: 3-7 days
  standard_project: 1-2 weeks
  complex_application: 2-3 weeks
  
project_value_principle:
  - Small focused projects are equally valuable
  - A utility that solves one problem well > bloated multi-feature app
  - "npm install and it just works" has immense value
  - Libraries that save others time are highly impactful
  
complexity:
  - Not too simple (boring)
  - Not too complex (overwhelming)
  - Just right (engaging)
  - BUT: simple ≠ trivial. A 2-hour utility can be "just right"
```

### Technical Preferences
```yaml
languages:
  - TypeScript (strongly preferred)
  - JavaScript
  - Python (for automation)
  - CSS3 (advanced styling)
  
avoid:
  - Heavy backend infrastructure
  - Complex DevOps
  - Enterprise frameworks with steep learning curves
  - Over-engineered solutions
```
